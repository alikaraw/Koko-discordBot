Instructions (for Retards101)
<description>
Heya! name's `Koco`. <@313707524891344903> created me to help your ass rate shows because some people are too dumb to even do the most simplest things and you are probably one of them! So let me help you with the instructions before your brain melts from your own stupidity **:)**

How to begin
<description>
As you can probably fucking see there is text channels inside this category named something along the lines of `blabla-show-ratings` or some shit along those lines.

click on one of those text channels in there you will see messages with smiley emojis under them.

now from here I'm fucking hoping you know what to do or so help me GOD you're more stupid than I imagined, but i digress... ima just finish this thing.

Under each message you will see emojis ranged from <:1_rating:974064368234938468> to <:10_rating:974064379781857291> to pick the emoji that represent how you feel about the show and bam! you rated a show. *(NICE!)*

I told you its so simple every retard can figure it out **:)** (well at least I hoped so)

Well there is this common knowledge called bed time, its when someone is fucking asleep and thus unresponsive.

**"hOw cAn i kNoW wHeN yOu aRe aWaKe?"**
Its fucking simple, look at my profile (seriously look at it!)
if you see me online (:green_circle:) it means I'm fucking awake.
if you see me offline (:white_circle:) it means I'm fucking asleep.

***(I know shooocking!)***

but don't worry you can still rate shows while I'm asleep I will just update the grade when I wake up again.
